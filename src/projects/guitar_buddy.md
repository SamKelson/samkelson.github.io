## Introduction

Learning to play the guitar can be a challenging and frustrating experience, especially for beginners and individuals with hand disabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce **Guitar Buddy**â€”an assistive device designed to make learning the guitar more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

## Empathy and Journey Maps

Before developing Guitar Buddy, we conducted interviews with four individuals to understand the common challenges faced by guitar learners. This research led to the creation of empathy and journey maps, highlighting key pain points and experiences.

## Problem Definition

Learning to play the guitar is often time-consuming and frustrating for the average person. For individuals with hand disabilities, the physical and mental demands can lead to abandoning the learning process altogether. Guitar Buddy aims to assist both beginner guitar players and those with disabilities by providing a supportive tool to ease the learning process.

## Thematic Analysis

Our interviews revealed several recurring themes:

- **Initial Struggles**: Many beginners struggle with holding the guitar and positioning their fingers on the strings.
- **Long-term Fatigue & Discomfort**: Extended playing periods often lead to discomfort and fatigue.
- **Product Recommendations**: Interviewees expressed interest in a product that could alleviate these challenges.
- **Arthritis Specific**: Individuals with arthritis or muscle weakness experience frustration due to pain while playing.

### Insight and "How Might We?" Statements

Based on our thematic analysis, we developed the following insights and questions:

- **Initial Struggles**: Many beginners struggle with the foundation of holding the guitar and finger positioning.
  - *How might we adjust our product to make it easier for people to hold the guitar or position their fingers properly?*

- **Long-term Fatigue & Discomfort**: Players feel discomfort after playing for extended periods.
  - *How might we design a solution that reduces fatigue and discomfort for guitar players during long sessions?*

- **Product Recommendations**: There is a clear interest in a product that addresses these challenges.
  - *How might we advertise our product to effectively reach and influence our target consumers?*

- **Arthritis Specific**: Individuals with arthritis feel frustrated when experiencing pain while playing.
  - *How might we adjust our product to accommodate and alleviate arthritic problems?*
