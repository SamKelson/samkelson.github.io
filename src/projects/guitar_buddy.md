Here is the full Fusion 360 file for creating custom buttons or chord shapes. To add new overlays:
- Create a new sketch plane on the fretboard
- Project the desired holes
- Connect and extrude upward

- [Full Fusion File](/assets/3DFiles/GuitarBuddy/GuitarBuddy.f3d)

You can also optionally print the **main body and fret fingers combined**:
- [Combined STL](/assets/3DFiles/GuitarBuddy/GuitarBuddyMainBodyAndFretFingersCombined.stl)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* While this option saves gluing time, it makes support removal more difficult. If attempting this, use **organic supports** and expect a longer print time.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Prepare Materials and Tools

**Materials**  
- PLA filament for all parts (body, fingers, buttons)  
- Elastic bands, Velcro straps, or hair ties  

**Tools**  
- 3D printer (e.g., Prusa Mini+)  
- Super glue  
- Sandpaper or file (optional for cleanup)

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî 3D Print All Parts

Load STL files into your slicer with the following settings:

- Layer height: 0.2 mm  
- Infill: 20%  
- Add build plate supports  
- Use PLA for all components

> üîß For fret fingers and all chord buttons, ensure the flat face is placed on the print bed.

## Prototype v1: Initial Design & Testing

![Prototype v1](/assets/images/guitarBuddy/guitar_buddy_banner.jpg)

Our first prototype was not designed from scratch‚Äîinstead, we began with an existing open-source design found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4544167). This initial model served as a foundation for testing the basic mechanics and ergonomics of a guitar fretting aid. Using this pre-existing design allowed us to quickly get feedback on core functionalities and start iterating toward our own customized version. While this first prototype helped validate some of our assumptions, we identified key areas for improvement, particularly in fit, usability, and compatibility across different guitar necks. These insights guided the development of our second, custom-designed prototype.

- The snug fit could damage guitar necks.
- The material was too rigid for long-term comfort.
- Buttons lacked visual indicators for beginners.
- Could not slide tool down guitar neck to get different playing positions.

### In-Class Testing Summary

We conducted our first round of testing in-class, partnering with the Tactile Map team to gather real-time feedback. Testers interacted with our low-fidelity model and provided insight into:

- **Learnability**: Most understood the concept but wanted better visual guides.
- **Efficiency**: The design worked but slowed down multi-chord transitions.
- **Errors**: Some users mounted the prototype incorrectly.
- **Satisfaction**: Overall enthusiasm was high for its accessibility potential.

### Feedback Capture Grid ‚Äì Prototype v1

We recorded detailed feedback using a capture grid format during this session. This allowed us to categorize insights and criticisms, helping define goals for the next iteration.

## Prototype v2: Iteration & Expanded Testing

![Prototype v2](/assets/images/guitarBuddy/prototypeV2.png)


In response to the issues with Prototype v1, we created a second version of Guitar Buddy in Fusion360. This prototype focused on making the device adjustable to fit various neck widths without damaging the guitar. We also considered replacing PLA with a more forgiving material and began experimenting with button labeling for beginners.

### External Testing & Interviews

We tested Prototype v2 with four target users:

- A beginner guitarist  
- An intermediate guitarist  
- An advanced guitarist  
- An occupational therapist

These testers confirmed that the new version addressed many issues from the first prototype, but additional refinements were still needed. Key takeaways included:

- Need for better visual and tactile indicators  
- Interest in a foldable or compact design for portability  
- Suggestions to improve comfort during extended play

### Feedback Capture Grid ‚Äì Prototype v2

We again utilized a feedback capture grid to synthesize this round of testing. The second grid reflected more user-specific insights and highlighted new directions for improvement.

## Iteration Log

### Addressing the Guitar Neck Taper

After printing and testing **Prototype 2**, we uncovered a critical mechanical issue: while the central pivot allowed the device to flex around the neck, it wasn‚Äôt enough to ensure that the fret overlays aligned properly with the guitar strings.

The issue stemmed from the **tapered shape of the guitar neck** ‚Äî as the neck widens slightly along its length, our original arm design caused the sides of the device to angle outward, breaking alignment with the frets. This misalignment reduced usability and defeated the purpose of accurate finger placement.

#### ‚úÖ Solution: Side Arm Pivots

We introduced **additional pivots** where the center arms connect to the device's sides. These pivots allow the sides of the device to **remain parallel to the guitar neck**, ensuring accurate fret alignment and improving cross-guitar compatibility. Crucially, it allows the device to slide along the neck of the guitar.

![Side Arm Pivots](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/SideArmPivots.png)

### Engineering the Fretboard Mechanism

Next, we focused on designing a **fretboard mechanism** that lets users press buttons ("fret fingers") to simulate finger placement.

Our goals:
- **Flexibility**: Fingers should bend under pressure and snap back into place.
- **Rigidity**: Pressing one finger shouldn't trigger movement in others.

We experimented with **TPU** and **PLA**, iterating through three major designs:

#### ‚ùå Flat TPU Sheet

- **Pros**: Flexible and easy to print.
- **Cons**: Covered the strings and frets completely, eliminating visual feedback. Button response was inconsistent and too soft.

![Flat TPU Sheet](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/FlatTPUSheet.png)

#### ‚ùå Three Protrusions,  One for Each String

- **Pros**: Better fret visibility and slightly improved finger action.
- **Cons**: Outer fingers had less torque (closer to pivot), making them hard to press. String alignment was challenging. TPU was too floppy; PLA was too rigid.

![Three Protrusions](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/ThreeProngs.png)

#### ‚úÖ Final Design: Single Rigid Arm with Three Fingers

- **Uniform torque** due to equal pivot distances.
- **Simpler alignment** with guitar strings.
- **Material choice**: PLA offered a good compromise. By varying thickness, we could achieve both flexibility and rigidity within the same part.

This design worked best across all metrics ‚Äî it was **snappy, aligned, and more reliable**.

![Final CAD Drawing](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/FinalCAD.png)

### Adding Modular Chord Buttons

To improve usability and allow users to easily press multiple fret fingers at once, we introduced **modular chord buttons**. These are custom-printed pressable overlays that connect to specific combinations of fret fingers, enabling users to form full chords with a single motion.

We achieved this by adding **holes to the tops of the fret fingers**. This allowed us to design snap-on chord buttons that can selectively press down any combination of fingers.

#### üîß How to Design a Chord Button

To create a new chord shape:

1. **Project** the holes of the fret fingers you want to press into a new sketch in Fusion360.
2. In that sketch, **connect the hole locations** using small beams or bridges.
3. **Extrude** a top surface (the button) to your desired height or shape.
4. Print the button and press it into the holes ‚Äî that‚Äôs it!

This modular system makes it easy to prototype different chord layouts, support new users, or even develop **song-specific overlays** for teaching purposes.

![Example Chord Button (D Chord)](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/DChordPresser.png)

---

### Final Fit Tuning

The last stage of our iteration process focused on **precise fitting and tolerances**. Even with a functional prototype, we had to resolve:

- Finger **height and spacing**
- Smooth yet stable **pivot movement**
- Reliable **grip across guitar neck sizes**
- Avoiding **component interference**

This phase required lots of **trial and error** ‚Äî tweaking CAD parameters by millimeters, adjusting print settings, and repeatedly re-fitting components. Though tedious, these refinements were essential for achieving a design that felt both polished and user-friendly.

---

### Quantitative Failure Testing

To further inform our design decisions and material choices, we conducted **basic force testing** on key components. This gave us quantitative insight into how much stress the device could withstand ‚Äî and where improvements were needed.

#### Test Setup

Using a force gauge, we applied increasing pressure to specific components until failure occurred. We ran two tests:

| **Test #** | **Test Description**                        | **Force Applied** | **Break Point** |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Test 1     | Force applied on the center pivot           | 63.5 N            | Component snapped at the main arm junction.<br>![Broken Arm](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/Test1.jpg) |
| Test 2     | Force applied to one of the fingers/pressers | 13.6 N            | Finger arm bent and detached under pressure.<br>![Finger Test](../assets/images/guitarBuddy/Test2.png) |

#### Observations

- The **center pivot** was robust, suggesting the main body structure could handle user-level stress without failure.
- The **fret fingers**, being thinner and more dynamic, broke at lower force thresholds ‚Äî which matches our expectations.
- These results validated the use of **PLA** with controlled thickness for fret fingers and informed later **reinforcement and sizing decisions**.
